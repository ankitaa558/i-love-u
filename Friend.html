    <h2>Open When you need a friend</h2>
    <p>Dear kavu,</p>
    <p>Hi baby, I need to tell u something. U know that before we r dating  we still talk and texted every day and we were good friends infact best friends. We maintained our friendship foe what i felt was a long time. So whenever u need help or advice from a friend and not from girlfriend, I still qualify. U can spill all u r secrets to me and u can lay on my shoulder when u need comfort. U can hug me until my back cracks but that will never stop me from being there for u. So if u ever need a friend, and all u r other friends r unable to talk, u can always count on me. U know i m an amazing friend; I care for all my friends deeply and value them tremendously. <strong><i>So baby, Tera yaar hu main!!!!</i></strong></p>
