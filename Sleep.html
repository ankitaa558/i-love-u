    <h2>Open When you cant sleep</h2>
    <p>Hey silly,</p>
    <p>You always stay up way too late. Try to text me and see if im still awake because Im, guarantee that i can help u feel better and sleep more soundly. But if u have opened thid link im guessing u have already tried getting in contact with me. I'll tell u things that I do when I cant sleep. The main thing I do is play scenario and made up stories in my head. Usally they about u or us, something thst I really wish would happen or I think about what will do that weekend. I'v done this since i wa little and it really helps me to put a calming visual in my mind pulls me to sleep. Its very comforting for me.So try and tell me. <strong><i>Goodnight sweetie!!!!</i> </strong></p>
