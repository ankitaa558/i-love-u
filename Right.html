    <p>Hey Love,</p>
    <p>Happy anniversary!! I cant believe we've made it so far. It feels like a few seconds just passed by, and would u look at that?  Honestly, I don't even know where the time went. It flew by faster than a shooting star. But anyway, this is my gift to u! i've have been working on these website since 11th of septembar. Every single day I would take time just to do a few letters and thse website   to make my waiting baby happy in the end. I knew all my efforts would be worth it. I knew when i saw the smile on ur face when u received these letters website  that it wouls all be worth it. I really hope u appreciate this special and unique gift because I put in endless amounts of hard work and poured all my love into these letters which inside these website <strong><i>(Our website)</i></strong>. I put my true feelingd into thses letters so I hope u enjoy reading them! I wish that every time u open one of my letters, ur face light up wuth joy. I wish u enjoy nd keep every gift i've made and given to u. I hope u feel tingles with every letter. And i hope my strong love flows from letters right to ur heart as u read my sweet words. Please be honest and only open these letters when the event actually happens to u. I know u well, and even if u want to open them at the right moment. This gift was made to be opened over a long period of time, so dont' lie just to open a letters. And another rule u must have to follow: only one leeter is allow to be per day. No more than that honey! Don't go over the limit please. I want this gift to longlast and be very meaningful. I love u, I love u forever and always. We already plan for imagica but when we don't know but even though i cant wait to go exploring the rides with u on a magical adventure. Its going to be a blast, trust me. Im sure we laughed, acted silly, acted loving and enjoyed each other time and company. Thank u so much baby for such an amazing and unbelievable time. I appreciate u and everything u do for me. The reason i wanted to make these website and letters I need to give u back all the love u give to me. I'm not best with words and expressing feelings. But as u view these letters at a later of time, u will see my efforts within the words and within sentenses. <strong><i>Once again love, enjoy this wonderful gift from ur forever!!!! </i></strong>  </p>
