    <h2>Open When we fight</h2>
    <p>Hi baby,</p>
    <p>I m sorry we r fighting chances are it is my fault. So let me just say i m sorry. I m sorry for the way i may have acted during the fight, know that the hurtful things i may have said simply due to anger. Unfortunately relationships involves
      bitter conflicts, and blowups are at times just a part of the relationships process what ultimately matters is not the fight itself but the way we work together to solve it. <strong><i>I m sorry if i hurt u my gem!!!!</i></strong></p>
