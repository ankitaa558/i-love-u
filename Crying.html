    <p>I told u dnt cry babylove! But since u cant help it, let me kiss ur tears away this time. I want to tell u a story....</p>
    <p>There's this girl who thought that no one in her life will love and care for her. So she decided to go with flow of life and love herself more because no one will ever do. But little did she know, she found her prince charming that God has given to her. A man will love her with all he can and will always be there to understand and support her. The girl is so happy and thankful thats why she promised to God and herself that she will always love and never let go the man no matter what.The girl and man name are Darlo and Kavu. Smile now baby because u r love said, she will never leave u and always stand next besides u. <strong><i>Love u plz smile now u know how much it hurts to see u crying!!!!</i></strong> </p>
