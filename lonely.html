    <h2>Open When you feel like giving up</h2>
    <p>Hey Emotional king,</p>
    <p>Please don't. I dont know what's going on at the moment, but I'm here for u. My love, I am right here, all yours to call and text and ask for advice. Also, I have a soft and comfortable shoulder for u to cry on any time u need someone. And I will sure listen to u and let u speak ur mind and get rid of all those negative thoughts. I'm sorry  for what u r going through baba. I know it must be horrible, and u feel like there is no hope left. During difficult time these, I know it is absolutely painful and challanging to think of bright side or think postive. I want to u remember times that were painful in our relation, or times we had problems or we arguing. They must bring back heartbreaking memories, but u wanna know how we got through them all? You want to know how we managed to solve all the issues between us, and build us back stronger than ever? We didn't give up on each other. We work together and tried to fix everything to make the other person happy. We never dismissed something just because it was too difficult or required to much efforts. Love,"Don't let todays trouble bring u down. Don't let lifes obstacles keep u from trying.Dont let ur fear keep back from dreaming. Dont give up for any reason. Believe in yourself." <strong><i>"You should never give up. No matter how hard the situation is. Always believe that something beatiful is going to happen."</i></strong> </p>
