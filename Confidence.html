    <p>My gentleman,</p>
    <p>Bae, we all get insecure at times. We all have those moments where we cant even find a single thing we like about ourselves. You might refer to yourself as mess of uncertainty and insecurities, but honey u r not. U have to learn that these are the things u shoukd appriciate about youeself the most.These r the things that make u different, and different is not necessarily a bad thing. I know there are some thinngs u may not like about yourself in general but u do realize that I adore all of them. All of ur"flaws" and "imperfections" r not flaws and imperfections to me.If u were to ask me on any day at any time, no matter what my mood was, if there was anything I would change about u if I could, my response would be absolutely nothing. U r perfect to me, u r perfect for me. Honestly, I believe that u r most amazing, most loving person in entire world.<strong><i>I love u so much my world!!!!</i></strong> </p>
